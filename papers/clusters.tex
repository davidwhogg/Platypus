\begin{abstract}
% Context:
The chemical-tagging hypothesis is that every star ought to carry---%
in its detailed chemical abundances---%
an informative signature of its molecular-cloud birth location and time.
This idea has not previously yielded scientific successes, probably because of the
noise in chemical-abundance measurements.
However, we have succeeded in substantially improving spectroscopic measurements with \thecannon\ 
(now delivering individual abundances with precisions around 0.04-dex).
% Aims:
We test the chemical-tagging hypothesis by looking at clusters in abundance space
and confirming that they are clustered in phase space.
% Methods:
We identify (by the k-means algorithm) overdensities of stars observed by the \apogee\ spectroscopic survey
in a 15-dimensional chemical-abundance space delivered by \thecannon,
and plot the associated stars in phase space.
We use \emph{only} abundance-space information (no positional information) to identify stellar groups.
% Results:
We find that clusters in abundance space are indeed clusters in phase space.
We recover some known clusters and find other interesting structures.
This confirms the chemical-tagging hypothesis and verifies the precision of abundances delivered by \thecannon.
This is the first-ever project to identify phase-space structures by blind search purely in abundance space;
the prospects for future data sets are very good.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

If every star in the Milky Way was born in a molecular cloud that has
unique chemical-abundance characteristics (as a function of time), and
if every star preserves its surface abundances (or significant aspects
of them) over its lifetime, then stars with common birthplaces and
time ought to be identifiable in their surface abundances.
That is, it ought to be possible to use stellar abundances to link up
co-eval stars---even if at the present day they are no longer close to
one another in phase space---and infer a detailed star-formation and
dynamical history for the Galaxy.
This idea has been dubbed ``chemical tagging''.
It was proposed long ago \citep{freeman} and is one of the
principal motivations for a number of surveys, most notably
\apogee\ \citep{apogee}, \gaiaeso\ \citep{gaiaeso} and \galah\ \citep{galah}.
In order to measure chemical tags and infer the Galaxy's dynamical
properties and formation history, these surveys are each measuring high resolution,
high signal-to-noise spectra for hundreds of thousands of stars across
the Galaxy's disk, bulge and halo.

Chemical tagging holds the promise of revealing not just the
star-formation history of the Galaxy, but also the accretion history
(as things that fall in are expected to be chemically distinct from
those that form in the parent body; \citealt{something}) and
stellar-orbit diffusion process like radial mixing and radial
migration (for example, \citealt{Roskar2009, quillen}).  After
stars are born---or after a star cluster is accreted and
disrupted---associations or groups will disperse, through either
coherent orbital evolution or else incoherent diffusion, but the
chemical-abundance tags can in principle make the former members
identifiable as co-eval stellar siblings.

Although undeniably promising---and although it has motivated the
launch of expensive, large-scale spectroscopic surveys---the
chemical-tagging idea has yet to yield scientific fruit.
Part of the reason is that the level of chemical specificity required
is very high:
If there are thousands of (relevant) molecular clouds forming stars in
the recent history of the Milky Way, it will take many abundances,
each measured accurately, to make a sufficiently unique fingerprint
that stellar sibling identification will be reliable.

Stellar spectroscopic surveys now have the resolution, signal-to-noise,
wavelength coverage, and sample sizes to deliver chemical tags.
There are, however, two big issues.
The first is that the physical assumptions behind the idea may require
refinement:
There may be chemical-abundance overlaps among open clusters
\citep{blancocuaresma}; coeval groups of stars may have similar tags
but different birth places \citep{mitschang}, and the
chemical-abundance space might be low in dimensionality \citep{what}.
On the other hand, precise studies of stellar twins \citep{melendez, jofre}
and open clusters \citep{bovy} indicates that chemical abundances ought to be
very precisely similar for co-eval stars.

The second issue for chemical tagging---and the one we address
here---is measurement precision (and accuracy).
The current precision on abundance measurements is not high enough
(for example, \citealt{martel, ting}).
That said, it is clear that the \emph{data} are precise enough;
there is enough signal-to-noise at the relevant locations in spectrum
space to deliver high-precision tags.
Our view is that the traditional methods for making abundance
measurements just aren't mature enough:
There are issues with the physical models, and the data-analysis
methods do not make use of all of the information in the data sets.
Improving the models and exploiting the entire information
content in the data is critical if we are going to deliver useful
chemical tags.

Our contribution in this space has been to develop
\thecannon\ \citep{thecannon, ages}, which is a data-driven model for
stellar spectra.
This model can deliver stellar parameters and chemical abundances to
stars, making use of every pixel of every stellar spectrum (that is,
all the information in the data) but making no use at all of physical
models of stars.
It relies only on there being training data---\emph{some} stars for
which parameters and abundances are known and believed.
In companion papers \citep{casey16, ness16} we show that
\thecannon\ can deliver 15 to 19 abundances for stars in the
\apogee\ survey, at precisions higher than even the training data on
which the model is trained.
We say more about this below.
We will show here that \thecannon\ improves chemical abundance measurements
to the point that \emph{chemical tagging is now possible.}
We have thereby effectively saved the collective asses of all the
collaborators in all of the above-referenced large spectroscopic
surveys.

One note on \emph{accuracy} and \emph{precision:}
In principle, the problem of chemical tagging does not require
absolute accuracy for chemical-abundance measurements.
We only require that we can precisely see that two stars are similar
in their abundances; even if we are wrong about the absolute values of
those abundances.
This point might make it seem like we don't care that our models are
wrong, so long as they are \emph{consistent.}
However, this is a bit misleading:
For chemical tagging to succeed, we need stars with different
atmospheric parameters $(\teff, \logg)$ but the same chemical
abundances to be assigned the same position in chemical-abundance
space.
That doesn't require overall accuracy, but it requires that the models
have the right dependencies on atmospheric parameters such that the
wrongness in abundance space is consistent across the H-R diagram.
That is, we need a substantial amount of accuracy to achieve our goals.

In what follows, we are going to use \apogee\ \acronym{DR12} data \citep{dr12}, in
which we can measure 15 element abundances (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si,
S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Ni).
The \apogee\ data set covers a huge radial extent and---because the
data are taken in the infrared---explores the thin disk.
However, it has the disadvantage that it's spatial coverage is swiss
cheese, which makes it hard to see, within the data set, linear or
extended stellar structures.
In many ways, \galah\ will deliver improvements, both because it will
have more abundances (possibly 29) and contiguous sky coverage.

One final note:
We think of this \documentname\ as performing a hypothesis test.
We know that the stellar members of open and globular clusters---stars
that are identified by being close in phase space---contain highly
informative abundance information that identifies them also in
chemical-abundance space.
Does this work the other way around?
Are groups of stars that are identified as being close in abundance
space---collections of stars with near-identical chemical tags---also
found to be close in phase space?
If the answer to this question is ``yes'' then chemical tagging is
\emph{on.}

\section{Sample and abundances}

The details about how we select, reduce, and analyze the \apogee\ data
are given in full detail in the companion papers \citep{casey16, ness16}.
We summarize briefly here.
For the spectroscopic data, we use the \apogee\ \acronym{DR12}
(\cite{dr12}) spectroscopic data reductions for red-giant stars
($\logg < 3.9$) that are not flagged as bad in the
\apogee\ \aspcap\ (\cite{aspcap}) pipeline reductions.
There are \totalnumber\ stars that make our $\logg$ and flag cuts.

The \apogee\ pipelines deliver stacked (co-added),
pseudo-continuum-normalized spectra, but we do not use these; we
perform our own continuum normalization on individual-exposure data
and co-add it ourselves.
This is required, because the performance of \thecannon\ depends
critically on the methods used for spectral normalization.  It does
not require accurate continuum estimation, but it requires that the
normalization vector be obtained by a \emph{linear operation on the
  data}.
The linear operation we use is a smooth-function fit to pixels
identified as continuum in our previous work \citep{thecannon}.

For the training data labels (used to train \thecannon; see below), we
use the \apogee\ \acronym{DR12} \aspcap\ atmospheric parameters and
15-element abundances, but only for the subset of ARC:XXXXX red-giant
stars that have spectral signal-to-noise ratio measurements greater
than 200.
This is a small fraction of the total sample, but these high
signal-to-noise stars are observed to obtain consistent, low-scatter,
sensible abundance-space measurements.

As described in the original paper \citep{thecannon} and the companion
papers \citep{casey16, ness16}, \thecannon\ is operated in two stages.
In the first stage---the traning step---the training set of stars with
measured spectra and known labels (known parameters and abundances) is
used to establish a likelihood function for a set of coefficients that
parameterize a smooth, simple prediction of spectral pixels given
labels.
\thecannon\ finds the set of coefficients that optimizes the
training-step likelihood function.
In the implementation used in this \documentname, the spectral
prediction is quadratic in labels (including all cross-terms to second
order), and there are 17 labels ($\teff$, $\logg$, and 15 abundances
referenced to H) and 8500 spectral pixels, so there are on the order
of 1.4 million coefficients set by a convex optimization in the
training step.

In the second stage---the test step---each unlabeled star is used to
establish a single-star likelihood function for labels, holding the
coefficients fixed.
\thecannon\ finds the labels that minimize the single-star likelihood
function for each test-set star.
This optimization is not convex, but it is embarrassingly parallel.
For the results shown here, the training step takes hours and the test
step takes less than an hour on a small research cluster in Cambridge.

Six two-dimensional projections of the abundance data, plus some other
data quantities, are shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:all}.

\begin{figure}[!p]

  \sectionname~\ref{sec:method}) performs clustering in a full
  15-dimensional abundance space of elements referenced to H (not Fe),
  but plots are shown here referenced to Fe for familiarity reasons.
  The bottom three panels show stellar meta-data not used in the
  clustering but used to test whether the abundance-space clusters
  are interesting spatially.\label{fig:all}}
\end{figure}

\section{Method and results}\label{sec:method}

Although only hints of small-scale clustering in the abundance space
are visible in \figurename~\ref{fig:all}, exploration of the data indicates that
known clusters do appear in the abundance space as over-densities.
(In general, the collapse of 15 dimensions down to 2-d projections
will hide, smooth, or dilute any structure; there is no guarantee that
a highly featured distribution in 15-d will show features in
\emph{any} 2-d projection, let alone axis-aligned, human-selected projections.)
This encourages us to look for over-densities automatically in the
abundance space and see if anything found that way would be over-dense
in phase space.
The simplest method for clustering points in $D$-dimensional space is
the \emph{k-means} algorithm (see \citealt{bishop} for a pedagogical introduction).
Briefly, the k-means algorithm is to find the points closest (in
$D$-space) to each of $K$ centers, and then take the mean of those
points to update the locations of the centers; iterate to convergence.
The output is the locations of the $K$ centers and the assignments of
all points to centers.
This algorithm is fast and performs well in practice in problems of
this nature.

The k-means algorithm has disadvantages, of course.
One is that $K$ must be chosen by hand (or heuristically at best).
Here we are only demonstrating a concept; we don't need to have the
best possible clustering.
For this reason we simply choose $K=128$, $K=256$, and $K=512$ and look at all the
results.
The algorithm also only performs local optimization.
At each $K$ we perform 32 restarts with different initializations, and
preserve the best clustering (best according to the k-means score).

Another issue with k-means is that it effectively uses metric
distances in the $D$-space; it presumes Euclidean isotropy.
We choose here to work in the hydrogen-normalized abundance space, the
space of [C/H], [N/H], [O/H], [Na/H], [Mg/H], [Al/H], [Si/H], [S/H],
[K/H], [Ca/H], [Ti/H], [V/H], [Mn/H], [Fe/H], [Ni/H].
But in addition to this, we re-scale these by approximate measurement
precisions obtained by \thecannon\ before running k-means.
This makes the space close to isotropic in measurement uncertainty or
observational precision.
Importantly we use \emph{only} abundance-space information, and no
positional or velocity information (nor $\teff$ nor $\logg$ nor any
targeting or observational meta-data) as input to the clustering
algorithm.

DWH: EXPLICITLY GIVE THE ABUNDANCE-SPACE SCALES USED.

One note on clustering algorithm decisions is warranted:
Because this project is just a demonstration of the chemical-tagging
concept, there is no requirement that we choose the best clustering
algorithm or the method that reveals the best structures.
Indeed, it is a feature of this work that even the simplest, most
generic, least tuned clustering algorithm returns interesting
structures (as shown below).
The prospects for Milky Way science only improve as the clustering
algorithm improves.

When the k-means results are returned, the $D\times D$ empirical
variance tensor for the members of each cluster can be constructed,
and an effective density can be computed as the number of points in
the cluster divided by the square-root of the determinant of the
tensor.
This density was used to rank abundance-space overdensities (from highest
to lowest) for visual inspection.
We chose a few interesting cases from many and show them in
\figurename~\ref{fig:M13}, \ref{fig:Pal5}, \ref{fig:Sgr},
\ref{fig:halo}, and \ref{fig:disk}.
The first three of these are known clusters M13, Pal5, and Sagittarius (MKN, ARC, help!).
The fourth is a halo structure with high velocity dispersion and possibly accreted.
The fifth is a thin-disk star-formation feature.
We will discuss these more below.

DWH \& HWR: How do we show that we aren't just getting clusters because \apogee\ has plate-to-plate calibration variations?

All of the code for the data manipulation, clustering, and
visualization is built on \project{numpy} \citep{numpy},
\project{scikit-learn} \citep{sklearn}, and \project{matplotlib}
\citep{matplotlib}.
All of the code written specifically for this project is available in
two open-source code repositories at

\section{Discussion}

We have demonstrated for the first time that, in a large-scale
spectroscopic survey of stars, stars that appear similar in
chemical-abundance properties are often associated physically in
clusters or other structures.
The reverse is well established---that is, that stars that are
associated physically in clusters are similar in chemical-abundance
properties (with a recent model-free test by \citealt{bovy}).
MKN: WHAT ELSE TO CITE HERE?
However, it was not known whether abundance-space information would be
precise enough, or \emph{measurable} precisely enough to find this
structure in surveys dominated by a large mix of stars from different
origins and ages (and there was good reason to be pessimistic;
\citealt{ting}).
We have demonstrated with a straightforward (and in no way optimal)
clustering in chemical-abundance space that it is easy to find co-eval
stellar structures.

What made this possible is substantial improvements in precision
delivered by \thecannon.
We don't have an absolute measure of the precision of the measurements,
but from looking at open and globular clusters, it appears to be on the
order of or better than 0.04~dex for the median element in the list of 15.
These improvements are discussed in detail in the companion papers
\citep{casey16, ness16} about the abundance measurements.
We believe these improvements come from a combination of factors, not
limited to (a)~improvements in the determination of pseudo-continuum,
(b)~the use of more spectral range than just unblended element windows
\citep{aspcap}, and (c)~accurate spectral predictions
(\thecannon\ delivers accurate predictions because it is fit to
observed data).
Furthermore, because abundance space is high in dimensionality, even
small improvements in abundance measurement get taken to a significant
power when thinking about information gains.

There is no sense at all in which \figurename~\ref{fig:M13},
\ref{fig:Pal5}, \ref{fig:Sgr}, \ref{fig:halo}, and \ref{fig:disk} show
a representative or complete set of features found in abundance space.
These features were hand-chosen to be obviously interesting and
interpetable.
There are many other things to be found in this data set!

On the particulars of these features, a few comments:
DWH: Comments about Sag and M13: They appear in multiple clusters.
MKN: Comments about the young disk feature and what it probably is?

The \apogee\ project shows great promise for these studies, and with
the appearance of the companion papers, we will release the
chemical-abundance measurements we used here for further study.
The future is even brighter, however: \apogee\ is expanding to 19
elements, more stars, and all-sky angular coverage with \apogee2, and
\galah\ is nearly ready to release chemical abundances on a larger set
of 29 elements.
The \apogee\ elements employed in this project include alpha
(Mg, O, Si, Ca, Ti), light proton-capture (C, N, S), odd-Z (Na, Al, K)
and iron peak (Fe, Ni, V, Mn) elements.
\galah\ will deliver element abundances from all the major
nucleosynthetic processes, including light proton capture elements,
alpha, odd-Z, iron-peak, light and heavy slow neutron capture, and
rapid neutron capture.
Chemical tagging capabilities are expected to grow as the
\emph{product} of the measured nucleosynthetic pathways.
