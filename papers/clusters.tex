\title{Chemical tagging:
       Identification of stellar structures purely by chemical-abundance similarity}
\author{DWH, MKN, AC, HWR, DFM, others}

\begin{abstract}
% Context:
The chemical-tagging hypothesis is that every star ought to carry---%
in its detailed chemical abundances---%
an informative signature of its molecular-cloud birth location and time.
This idea has not previously yielded scientific successes, probably because of the
noise in chemical-abundance measurements.
However, we have succeeded in improving vastly spectroscopic measurements with \thecannon\ 
(now delivering individual abundances with precisions around 0.04-dex).
% Aims:
We test the chemical-tagging hypothesis by looking at clusters in abundance space
and confirming that they are clustered in phase space.
% Methods:
We identify (by the k-means algorithm) overdensities of stars observed by the \apogee\ spectroscopic survey
in a 15-dimensional chemical-abundance space delivered by \thecannon,
and plot the associated stars in phase space.
We use \emph{only} abundance-space information (no positional information) to identify stellar groups.
% Results:
We find that clusters in abundance space are indeed clusters in phase space.
We recover known clusters and stellar streams.
This confirms the chemical-tagging hypothesis and verifies the precision of abundances delivered by \thecannon.
This is the first-ever project to identify phase-space structures by blind search in abundance space;
the prospects for future data sets are very good.

\section{Introduction}

DWH: Chemical tagging yada yada (CITE).

DWH: Open clusters look one-metal (CITE); globulars look peculiar (CITE); but no-one has ever gone the other way! 

DWH: Fast intro to \apogee.

DWH: Fast intro to \thecannon.

DWH: BASH the \apogee\ discontiguous field positioning.

\section{Data and method}

MKN: Details about \apogee\ data.

AC: Details about \thecannon\ and implementation.

DWH: Figure showing the full data set; discuss structure.

DWH: Clustering methodology.

\section{Results and discussion}

DWH: For the first time, we see small-scale informative features in abundance space.

DWH: When we identify the small-scale features in abundance space, they are informative in position space.

DWH: How do we show that we aren't just getting clusters because \apogee\ has plate-to-plate calibration variations?

DWH: Chemical tagging will work.
